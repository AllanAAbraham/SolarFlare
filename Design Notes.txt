FILE STRUCTURE
- ISolarPowerService interface -> methods 
- SolarPowerservice implements ISolarPowerService "backend" file -> hashmap, api calls these methods to access Map
- SolarPowerController "endpoint" file -> contains get endpoints
- SolarPower "object" class -> solar power object:
    -> properties:
        name (string)
        capacity kw (double)
        address (string)
        city (string)
        state (string)
        zip (string)

When localhost is run, first thing that should happen is

FUNCTIONALITY
- opening projects.json 
- create a HashMap (Dict) where key is id (int) value is solarPanel object
- run through entire json doc, creating new solarPanel object when new key is found and adding both 
key : solarPanel_id object to the hashMap
- if any property is empty in json -> add "unavailable" string to that property in the object 
{ could throw error instead in future }

WHEN TO THROW ERROR:
- if file not found or is empty -> throw error and terminate application

Query Strings to trigger Get endpoints
Return from endpoints will be json

GET
Routing: localhost /SolarFlare/info?id=(string_id)
1) Get basic info about a solar farm by id (name, capacity, city, state, etc.)

FUNCTIONALITY: 
- search HashMap with id
- return json version of solarPanel_id 

WHEN TO THROW ERROR:
- throw http error if id not specified or id is not number
- else throw "id not found" some http error


GET
Routing: localhost /SolarFlare/info?state=(string_state)
2) Get a list of solar farms in a given state (MA, NY, RI)

FUNCTIONALITY: 
- iterate through hashMap_keys and HashMap_values
- build a list of objects when input_state == solarPanel_State
- return json version of list

WHEN TO THROW ERROR:
- throw http error if state not specified or if input is not in Set of state abbreviations


GET
Routing: localhost /SolarFlare/info?minCap=(string)&maxCap=(string)
3)Given a capacity range (minimum capacity and maximum capacity) return a list of solar farms 
with capacity within the specified range (ex. 100kw - 500kW)

FUNCTIONALITY: 
- if min or max capacity not specified, default to 100kw and 500kw respectively
- iterate through hashMap_keys and HashMap_values
- build a list of objects when minCap<=solarPanel_capacity<=maxCap
- return json version of list or
- return json containing ("No solar panel system found within given range of capacity") if none is within range

WHEN TO THROW ERROR:
- if capacities specified are not number, throw http error


GET
Routing: localhost /SolarFlare/month?id=(string)
4) Given a solar farm id, return the month in which it generated the most energy (generated 
energy is in the `total` column of the project's generation data file

FUNCTIONALITY: 
- concatenate id to '_data.csv' like `{farm_id}_data.csv`
- open file path this/generation_data/`{farm_id}_data.csv`
- csv is formatted:
  row 1 is ts column, total column
  ts is format of 2018-01-01T00:00:00
  need to parse month and year out 
   double for total column numbers
- method needs to first parse out the month and year
- iterate through ts and retrieve corresponding total value
- (if no total value given but there is a ts for that row, add use 0 instead)
- sum of all rows where month and year is same
- insert into hashMap key = year-month (string),  value = sumation
- iterate through entire ts and total column and rows filling in hashMap
- iterate through hashmap create a list of keys where sum = max in case situation where instances of multiple max sums
- turn list of keys into list of touples (or do it in 1 step above in format of (month, year)  (max_keys)
   have a map of key: month_num, value: ("name_of_month")
- if len of max_keys = 1: create string "The month where Solar Panel System (ID) generated most energy is
  (month_map[touple_month), (touple_year)."
-if len of max_keys > 1
   iterate max_keys through max_keys and build string:
   (month_map[touple_month_1), (touple_year_1), (month_map[touple_month_2), (touple_year_2), etc
   create string " The months where Solar Panel System (ID) generated most energy are: " + concatenate above string

- return as plain text or in json

WHEN TO THROW ERROR:
- throw http error is input is not a number
- if file not found throw http error
